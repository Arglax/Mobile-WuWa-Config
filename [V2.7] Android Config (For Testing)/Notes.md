This config is for android (and hopefully iOS) for WuWa Game Version 2.7

This has been tested for Poco X6 Pro (Mediatek 8300 Ultra) and provides good graphics quality and smooth performance.
- Vulkan is forced in this config via Engine.ini

*This is being further tested by people who joined the discord channel.

Possible bugs/issues:
1. Black graphics occurence when app is not focused.
- such as when you have a floating windows for another app or using native screenshot
2. Heating is a bit expected, however, no case of overheating (40C above) for now
